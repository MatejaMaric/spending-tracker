# About this project:

I'm making this app to help me manage my spending.

My bank doesn't have open API endpoints for me to use, so I need to scrape HTML tables from theirs web interface...

## How to run this project:

This project uses [Fyne](https://fyne.io), so you we will need to install libraries it requires for your platform.

```
go build -v
./spending-tracker
```
